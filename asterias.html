<P>Named for the local starfish, <I>Asterias</I> was built of white and
southern hard pine and was similar in design to commercial fishing boats
of the era. The <I>Asterias</I> and the <I>Atlantis</I> were built as the
Institution's first vessels. </P>

<P>The first <I>Asterias</I> made at least 10,000 short trips, from Maine
to New York, primarily for the testing of scientific gear. Nearly every
member of the scientific and technical staff had a need for <I>Asterias</I>
at some time. Her excellent design and construction made her a natural
seaboat. </P>

<P><I>Asterias</I> was sold to Ocean Research Engineering in1980. In 1985
Edwin Athearn, her former captain saved her from destruction and together
with Dave Lewis restored the ship's name and condition. <BR>

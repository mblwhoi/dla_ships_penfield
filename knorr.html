<P><I>Knorr</I> was delivered to WHOI in April 1970. R/V <I>Knorr</I> (AGOR-15)
was named in honor of Ernest R. Knorr, a distinguished early hydographic
engineer and cartographer who was appointed senior civilian and Chief Engineer
Cartographer of the US Navy Hydographic office in 1860. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Knorr</I> is an all purpose scientific vessel designed to accommodate
a wide range of oceanographic tasks. Its forward and aft azimuthing propellers
allow the ship to move in any direction or to maintain a fixed position
in high winds and rough seas. The vessel’s other unique features, like
anti-roll tanks and ice strengthened bow, enable <I>Knorr</I> to travel
the world’s oceans. <BR>
<BR>
In 1991 <I>Knorr</I> returned to WHOI after undergoing a 32 month major
mid-life refit. The vessel was upgraded and refitted at the McDermott Shipyard
in Amelia, Louisiana. An additional 34' was added to <I>Knorr's</I> length
at the middle providing room for a new laboratory and machinery space.
In addition, <I>Knorr's</I> twin azimuthing propulsion system was installed.

Sister ship: <I>Melville</I>, operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography,
University of California, San Diego. <BR>

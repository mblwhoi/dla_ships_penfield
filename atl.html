<P><I>Atlantis</I> was the first Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution research
vessel and the first ship built specifically for interdisciplinary research
in marine biology, marine geology and physical oceanography.&nbsp; Columbus
Iselin, her first master and a major influence in her design, felt that
speed was not essential; steadiness, silence and cruising range were of
primary importance. </P>

<P>Once built WHOI searched for an appropriate name for the research vessel.
A trustee of the Institution, Alexander Forbes, had recently bought a schooner
named <I>Atlantis</I> from Iselin. Mr. Forbes rechristened his schooner
so the new research vessel could be named <I>Atlantis</I>.<BR>
<BR>
The “A- boat” made 299 cruises and covered 700,000 miles, doing all types
of ocean science. In 1966, <I>Atlantis</I> was sold to Argentina, refurbished,
and renamed <I>El Austral</I>. It is used as a research vessel and is crewed
by Argentine naval personnel.&nbsp; </P>

<P><I>Ships and Submarines owned, operated or leased by the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution</I> is a collection of photographs and descriptive
information concerning the vessels operated by WHOI from 1930 to the present.
First created in 1995, this 1999 version has expanded and updated the original.</P>

<P>All the vessels, with the exception of the Deep Submergence vehicle,
Alvin, and the <I>Cubmarine</I> are surface ships ranging in size from
small special purpose rafts to large ocean going ships, such as the 279
foot<I> Knorr</I>. WHOI often operates vessels owned by the US Navy or
the National Science Foundation, larger ships in particular. Over the years,
WHOI has owned or leased a number of smaller vessels. Vessels owned or
leased by WHOI from which little scientific work was done, or for which
little information could be found, are grouped in the Appendix. </P>

<P>Photos from both the WHOI Data Library and Archives and the Information
Office, were scanned for this project. Paper copies of this work may be
consulted at the Information Office or the Library.</P>

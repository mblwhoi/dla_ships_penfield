<P>The vessel first sailed under the name <I>Harvard</I> for the North
Atlantic Fishery Investigations. In 1941 she was rebuilt, renamed <I>Bellefonte</I>
and used by the US&nbsp;Navy for war patrol. Upon her return to Woods Hole
in 1944, under the name <I>Albatross III</I>, the vessel was used intermittently
until 1955, when funding became available. <I>Albatross III</I> was under
full operation until 1959, when decommissioned and sold to a Hyannis, MA,
fisherman. </P>

<P><I>Albatross III</I> was loaned to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
from 1951-1952, and was also used jointly on other cruises from 1948-1959.
<I>Albatross III</I> made a total of 128 cruises, all in the North Atlantic.
Most of these were part of fisheries investigations, but many cruises included
hydro stations, bottom photographs, drift bottle exercises, and current
measurements. </P>

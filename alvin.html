<P><I>Alvin</I> is a deep diving research vessel designed specifically
for oceanographic research. It is owned by the US Navy and operated by
WHOI. Capable of diving 14,764 feet deep, <I>Alvin</I> makes as many as
200 dives a year. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;<I>Alvin’'s</I> numerous unique dives have made it famous. In 1966
<I>Alvin</I> was pressed into service by the US Navy to perform a unique
salvage operation. A hydrogen bomb had accidentally been dropped off the
coast of Spain in the Mediterranean Sea. After two attempts <I>Alvin</I>
successfully located the bomb. In 1974 <I>Alvin</I> was used for Project
Famous (French -American Mid-Ocean Underwater Studies), and made 17 dives
along the rift valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. <I>Alvin</I> is also well
known for its use in the discovery and observation of the ocean liner Titanic.
The sub has completed more than 3,300 dives. <BR>

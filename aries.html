<P>The <I>Aries</I>, a 93 foot ketch, arrived in Woods Hole in March 1959
as a gift from R.J. Reynolds. She was refitted as a research vessel by
June 1959 and was then used continuously on current measuring cruises off
Bermuda as part of a joint project shared by WHOI and the British National
Institute of Oceanography until August 1960.&nbsp; Her longest stay ashore
was from December 14th, 1959, until February 2nd, 1960, when her engine
was replaced by the a spare reconditioned and brought from England. Bermuda
proved to be a particularly good base for the Aries since her fresh water
storage limited her time at sea to about two weeks. <BR>
</P>

<P><I>Aries</I> spent a total of 206 days at sea, 186 days of which were
on cruises to deep-water, and of this deep-water time 129 days were spent
in the selected working area.&nbsp; Captain J. W. Gates was in charge until
after the refit when Captain H. H. Seibert took over until the end of the
project.&nbsp; Mr. C. L. McCann was mate for the entire period.&nbsp; (See
<I>Oceanus</I> Vol. VII, No.3, March 1961) </P>
